# Map3 üó∫Ô∏è - Decentralized Community Issue Reporting

**Demo**  
‚û°Ô∏è https://map3.app (coming soon)

## üî¥ Problem
Cities and communities struggle with inefficient infrastructure reporting systems and non-transparent prioritization on infrastructure fixes.  
Citizens have no direct way to report, track, and prioritize local issues.  
Traditional systems are centralized, opaque, and disconnect citizens from the decision-making process.  
Reports get lost, responses are slow, and there's no transparency about what gets fixed and why.  

## üü¢ Solution
**Map3** is a decentralized platform that empowers communities to report, verify, and prioritize local issues directly on a map.  
Citizens can report anything they want, like:
- New potholes
- Fallen trees
- New graffiti, whether it's a cultural addition or just damage
- Criminal activities
- Spontaneous events
- Hidden "real life easter eggs" like a remote beach, accessible through a certain path people drew on their personal but shared Map3


### Description 
A decentralized application where citizens can report local issues by placing markers on a map.  
Each community can configure what types of issues can be reported and what information is required.  
Reports are verified by the community and can trigger proposals for fixes.  


**Map3** allows people to follow each other, so that new discoveries trigger notifications.  
This feature is crucial for real-time alerts and emergencies, allowing peers and close contacts to share warnings in case of local threats, making it suitable as a disaster and crime warning system.  
The map-based DAO approach also highlights nearby businesses people can engage with, potentially participating in their internal protocols.  
The goal is to provide a global community overview centered on one mission.  
Local DAO research groups could instantly mark discoveries‚Äîlike new species in the wild‚Äîor share urgent findings in their field, notifying every researcher involved.  

Built with Universal Profiles and blockchain technology, **Map3** creates a transparent, community-driven system for civic improvement.
